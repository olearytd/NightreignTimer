# Elden Ring Nightreign Timer

## 🕰️ Features

- Real-time countdown aligned with the in-game time cycle
- Visual cues for upcoming transitions
- Manual override to sync if out of phase
- Home Screen widget support (WIP)
- Live Activity / Dynamic Island integration (Planned)

## 📲 Installation

Available on the Apple App Store.

## 🛠 Development

This is an iOS SwiftUI project built with Xcode. Contributions are welcome.

Clone the repo:

```

Open `NightreignTimer.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build/run on a physical device for best results (Live Activity requires a real device).
